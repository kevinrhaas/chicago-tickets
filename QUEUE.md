# QUEUE — top is next. The parser reads only uncommented T-NNNN lines; ticket files hold evidence and acceptance.
# The owner sets the order; every re-rank is logged in QUEUE_ORDER.md. Work top-down, skipping a blocked ticket or a
# LIVE claim (a claim past the 3h run window is a dead run, and `claim` takes it). Read each ticket before you claim it.
#
# STANDING RULES
# - Add a finding to the ticket it was found in before filing a new one. `ticket.mjs new` refuses at 140 queue lines
#   (T-1295) unless `--anyway --why "<reason>"`.
# - A follow-up goes to the band of its KIND (owner, 2026-10-20): performance, GPU, memory and frame-time work to the foot of
#   band 1; a building's to that building's band, beside its own tickets; loop operations (tooling, lap, claims, bake and
#   rederive faults, measurement gaps) to the foot of band 9 (owner, 2026-09-27), unless dev's gate is red or the build in
#   hand cannot finish without them.
# - A decision only the owner can make: `ticket.mjs ask`. The ticket keeps its place and runs skip it until answered.
# - Human figures are drawn once the portable-humans tickets (8C) render them, and Native and Metis people may be depicted
#   on informed, evidence-bounded judgement (owner, 2026-10-16; T-2672 updates the standing constraint).
#   Keep review flags and reasons; they do not veto release. The August gathering is excluded from 1 July 1835.
#   Black residents, families and businesses stay identified. Respect needs_bake and every ticket-level blocker.
# - Order (owner, 2026-10-16; band 9 moved up 2026-10-20): the performance and GPU group (band 1), loop operations (band 9),
#   1904 structures already in progress (band 2), the Navigator interface (band 3), then the balance of Prairie Avenue
#   1904 (band 7, nearest Glessner first), then the portable humans (8C). The Unreal holds are commented out, by hand only.

# --- 1. PERFORMANCE AND GPU — the whole optimization group, cleared first (owner, 2026-10-16: "move all of those gpu and performance
# ---    tickets above all of the house tickets let's clear those first"; earlier the same day: "clear all of the optimization tickets").
# Owner, 2026-10-16: "in a browser on mobile we get memory crashes and it's getting jittery ... keep it simple and lightweight ... rely on the local cpu gpu". Mobile performance and memory group T-2546..T-2558 (not T-2552), dependency order: measure, cut CPU/geometry, cut textures, smooth frames, then the WebGPU spike (T-2558, ruled (a) 2026-10-16). Same day: "tap into local computing resources ... based on the browser and platform or ... a big package app download that happens up front" added T-2559 (device profile), T-2560 (prebuilt town), T-2561 (download the year to disk).



# --- 9. LOOP IMPROVEMENTS — operations: the loop's own tooling (lap, claims, merge, gates, tickets). Owner, 2026-10-20: right under
T-3173 — 1904 desktop memory 1171.2 MB over its 1125 MiB ceiling: unmeasured since 2026-10-24 while the frame-time nightly died installing Playwright on ubuntu-26.04 (T-3169 un-blinded it on PR #1339); bring the 1904 scene down or argue a new ceiling in tools/memory_ceilings.json with its reading
T-3213 — 1904 phone memory 409.4 MB over its 400 MiB ceiling on dev: the memory job never runs on dev pushes, so dev drifted over unseen; bring the 1904 phone scene back under 400 or argue a new ceiling in tools/memory_ceilings.json with its reading
# ---    the performance band, and GPU or performance follow-ups go to band 1, a building's to its own band, not here.

# --- 2. 1904 STRUCTURES IN PROGRESS — every Prairie Avenue house already begun, finished next (owner, 2026-10-16: "finish any
# ---    existing in progress buildings in 1904"): Keith (1808), Glessner's sign-off, 1621-1625, 1637, then 1801, 1812 and 1811,
# ---    whose K01 massing pieces have merged.
# Owner, 2026-10-13: "Sure" (move T-1882 to the top) — 1808 Prairie rebuilt to its photographs, thread "Keith house vs photos"; T-1883 waits on it and takes this line when it merges.
# Owner, 2026-10-12: "Can you move these up to top you started most of this house finish it" (T-2369 is worked interactively; T-2370, T-2371 for the loop).
# Owner, 2026-10-13, with the 1887-91 Prairie Avenue sidewalk postcard: "we want to emulate this" (curbs and carriage walks, parkway trees with a Trees setting, soft surface edges). T-2473..T-2475, worked interactively in thread "Prairie Avenue streetscape", one PR each.
# Owner, 2026-10-13, thread "1812 structures": "For 1812 did I ask you to build the other buildings from that era ... all known structures from history"; card answer "After Prairie group"; "You can include native lodges as documented" (T-2490); card answer "Move to 14 August" (T-2490 moves the 1812 scene date first). T-2485 and T-2486 wait on T-2484 (same site) and take its line in turn.
# Owner, 2026-10-12, with photographs of the Prairie Avenue door: "the front door arch on the east also has the same stone treatment and should stand out more ... refer to the photos in the reference to make it photographic perfect" (T-2416 + T-2215, one PR, worked interactively; T-2212 waits on them).

T-1890 — Finish 1801 Kimball corner mansion architecture
T-3203 — 1904 front-yard plantings on every Prairie house lot: lawns, foundation shrubs, beds
T-3214 — 1612 Goodman and 1620 Law Prairie: flagged front walks through their iron fences' entrance gates and cinder side walks through their side gates, matched to their pictures
T-3215 — 1616, 1621, 1623, 1625, 1637 Spalding and 1638 Shortall-Gregory Prairie (the other pictured 1600-block houses): walks to their doors and front and side boundaries matched to their pictures
T-3216 — The unpictured worked 1600-block Prairie houses (1600, 1601, 1604, 1608, 1609, 1611, 1613, 1615, 1619, 1626, 1628, 1630, 1634, 1636, and 1635 Forsyth if worked): a stated reconstruction of each walk and front boundary consistent with the block
T-3205 — Worked 1700-block Prairie houses: walks, gates, front and side boundaries to their pictures

# --- 3. THE NAVIGATOR — the interface work from the owner's Navigator design doc (owner, 2026-10-16: "then we do all of this
# ---    interface work, follow that with the balance of buildings in 1904"). Filed into this band in dependency order.
# Order: the two card bugs from the review and the gold/silver/bronze grade colors, then E1 arrival, E2 the Navigator shell, the string table, E3 HUD, E4 Jaunts, E5 the
# building dossier (summary record, Glessner pilot, Inspect), E6 Confidence view, E7 Move, E9 Map/Jump/Settings with Researcher
# mode, sound and the field log (owner rulings 2026-10-16), E8 Guide and Tour, then the E10 content gates. Each ticket names what
# it waits on under "Depends on"; take the next workable one while a dependency is open. Spec: chicago-tickets
# evidence/navigator-mk2-2026-10-16/DESIGN.md. NAV-1006 (student playtest, T-2670) is held in band 8F.
# Owner, 2026-10-20: sound off by default; the gaze tag to the right nav under the address, smaller, fading by default (T-2941, T-2942, one PR).

# --- 7. SOUTH THROUGH TIME — PRAIRIE AVENUE 1904, ARCHITECTURAL ASSET PROGRAMME (T-1837)
# Umbrellas T-0475, T-0476 and T-0477 were closed as split into the T-1837 children below (2026-10-16); their files keep the scope.
# Owner, 2026-10-01: “Go”; “Push the tickets to dev queue in one group below”.
# One contiguous group below all existing work. Dependencies first; individual dependency and needs_bake gates remain in each ticket.
# Owner, 2026-10-08: "a controlled set of tickets to do an initial pass of the whole district ... then the tickets later for each building can refine
# your initial serviceable good draft model layer". Order: reconciliations, components, then the DISTRICT DRAFT PASS (T-2159 the 18th-20th block and the
# draft builder, T-2160 16th-18th, T-2161 20th-22nd, T-2162 the edges, T-2163 the grounds and the whole-district phone walk), then the per-building
# REFINEMENT tickets ("Build ..." retitled "Refine ..."), each depending on its block's draft. The draft pass is capped at five; it splits only in halves.
# Owner, 2026-10-11: "Move all the Glessner house refine tickets below 2352 and un comment them for the loop to pick them up put them above 2341". The Glessner group (T-2201, T-2207..T-2228, audit order) runs here one at a time: each later
# ticket waits in 8b on the one before it and takes this line when that PR merges (same house, owner 2026-10-10 "one at a time").
# Owner, 2026-10-14: "can you move the tickets up that are the building around Glessner, like build out from Glessner north and south, where we refine each building". Below the Glessner line, the two bake faults and the structures already in progress (owner, 2026-10-14: "Keep anything near the top of that prairie queue that is already a structure in progress, finish those and move on to the stuff nearest Glessner": 1638, 1619-1625, 1637), the refine work runs nearest-first by distance from 1800 Prairie, both sides of the street and both directions; a house's Refine before its Finish, back-lot service tickets after their side of the block, boundaries after those, edges and block checks last.
T-3161 — 1729 Pullman's other pictures solved (the 1890 Albertype plate, the CHM 1905 oblique and side views, the Taylor album views) and every view of the main house worked to matches
#   ? T-3161 DECISION: May J. W. Taylor's photograph no. 1445 of the Pullman house (the AIC album print a16-aic-taylor-album-pullman-p69 and print 16399, a16-aic-taylor-pullman-from-nw, one negative of the 1890s) be committed to the repo as reference copies for the image gate? The Prairie library records both as 'rights unknown — link only' (AIC: 'contact the Archives for publication information'), whereas the 1801 Kimball Taylor print committed under T-2538 is recorded as public domain by age. The camera is already solved (docs/RESEARCH/photo-match/pullman_house_1729_prairie/taylor-1445-camera.md) and the 18th Street stack was built from it in PR #1350. — (a) Yes: treat the 1890s Taylor commercial prints as public domain by age, as with Kimball's, and commit them with attribution so the camera joins the gate  (b) No: keep them link-only; Pullman is gated on the Detroit print and the Albertype plate alone, and Taylor is cited as evidence only — recommended: (a)
T-3210 — 1827 Prairie's porch from the Doane photograph: its round arches on the street and south faces, and its steps (the print's flight, rising behind the street tree, read through the camera: along the front or straight in under the north arch)
T-3191 — 1827 Prairie's other two pictures and its finish: the oblique exterior photograph's and the 1927 fire item's cameras solved, the rear step on the south flank, the side, rear and roof treatment finished, and every 1827 match record brought to matches (after the pieces before it)
T-3186 — 1901 Prairie's pictures worked to matches: the oblique exterior photograph's and the 1893 Pictorial Chicago plate's cameras solved, the south flank's bays, stacks and dormers, the portico's capitals and the stoop's curved cheeks, the 1896 reprint and the elevation drawing weighed, and every 1901 match record brought to matches (after the piece before it)
T-3208 — 1900 Prairie's other pictures worked to matches: the 2024 front, the mid-century front, the 1972 NRHP oblique and the c. 2014 detail weighed as later evidence, the 1800-1900 elevation drawing read, and every 1900 match record brought to matches (after the piece before it)
T-3211 — 1700 and 1706 Prairie onto K01 from the two photographs of the pair's front: Chicagology's and the Christmas print's cameras carried over from 1708's solve, the mirrored brick fronts under a dormered mansard with its railed deck, the arched principal windows and their balconettes, the stone porches on columns at the outer ends, and both houses' match records on those two views brought to matches
T-3220 — Re-budget the published tree: site/4d is full at 416 MiB, so no new textured Prairie house can land (dev ~413.8 MiB; #1384 adds 4.0)
T-3212 — 1700 and 1706 Prairie's two 1901 construction photographs weighed: their cameras solved, their match records written as evidence of their own date, the 1702 address association written on the record, and the pair compared before and after against the district draft from the same poses (after the piece before it)

# --- 8C. PORTABLE HUMANS — Blender is canonical; browser/three.js first, Unreal is a later consumer
# Owner, 2026-10-08: "move the portable people tickets after the south through time tickets" — moved here, below the whole Prairie Avenue 1904 programme (draft pass, refinements, block checks, Glessner repair).
# Owner, 2026-10-03: had moved it to sit directly above the Prairie Avenue 1904 architectural programme.
# Owner, 2026-09-30: build the human library and browser rendering path before loop optimization; Mark Beaubien is the first end-to-end historical example.
T-1789 — Build the first modular 1835 human library in Blender on the shared portable rig
T-1790 — Build the portable human animation library: idle, walk, talk, gesture and work clips on the shared Chicago rig
T-2673 — Mark Beaubien's evidence sheet and Blender master: dated likeness evidence with attested likeness, period analogy and reconstruction kept apart, the figure assembled from the T-1789 library on the shared rig, inspected front, three-quarter and profile renders, and LODs exported through T-1787
T-2674 — Mark Beaubien in the browser: the actor bound to the existing beaubien_mark person at his authored place, idling, walking when driven, greeting, selectable, and handing off to his card
T-2675 — Mark Beaubien inspected and measured in the real 1835 scene at desktop and mobile: close, conversation and street distances checked for contact, scale, shadows, foot slide and LOD popping, with shipped size, triangles, draw calls, texture memory and frame cost recorded and defects fixed
T-1792 — Scale portable humans beyond the first NPC: browser LOD, culling, animation budgets and population assembly

# --- 8D. PERIOD CARRIAGES AND WAGONS — photographic models, then motion, then boarding/riding (epic T-2791)
# Owner, 2026-10-18: "build tickets for these, place them in the queue in bands below the portable humans";
# first review existing assets and dated photographic evidence, then models, moving distant traffic and interaction.
# T-2792 and T-2799 completed through PR #1174; retain each remaining model's rights, date and needs_bake gates.
T-2793 — Build one articulated period wagon master from the existing wagon families
T-2980 — Upgrade selected covered wagons while preserving their distinct finishes
# Owner 2026-10-21: upgrade covered wagons as ready; preserve their existing visual variety so they do not become clones (follow-up recorded in T-2793).

# --- 8F. PLAYTESTS — HELD (owner, 2026-10-19: "Let's put all of those playtest tickets in a common band below unreal and hold
# ---     them for now"). Commented holds, never claimable; a run does not prepare their materials until the owner lifts the hold.
# HOLD T-2670 — Student playtest (NAV-1006): 6-8 students aged 14-16, three tasks (find a house, learn who lived there, tell
#     Attested from Reconstructed), 80 % unaided. Needs the owner to arrange the students; T-2663 (tour) and T-2637 (Glessner

T-3043 — Guide's glossary tap check finds no locked term on Home since its Confidence view tile became a button
T-3218 — Glessner carriage way: a brick strip floats across the court mouth over the sunk floor
T-3219 — 1904 gas lamps to a photographic match: post, boss, capital, arms, lantern and roof read off the 1811, Taylor 2135 and 2140 photographs (owner, 2026-10-28)
