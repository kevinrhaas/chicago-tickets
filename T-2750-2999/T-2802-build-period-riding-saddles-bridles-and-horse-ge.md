## Depends on

T-2799, T-2800. Read each dependency before claiming; do not silently skip its proof.

## Scope and acceptance

Build **one** source-bounded riding saddle/bridle/reins assembly for the chosen scene date, distinct from the draft harness. A dated later photograph alone cannot establish an 1835 saddle pattern.

- Choose and record cleared period construction evidence; identify riding style and seat/stirrup arrangement without unsupported breed/class assertions. Model saddle/tree silhouette, girth, stirrup leathers/stirrups, bridle/bit/reins and any source-supported accessories.
- Fit the T-2800 body without floating leather or visible penetration; include saddle/seat, stirrup, hand/rein and bit anchors for portable-human rig fitting.
- Export modular portable gear and LODs with material/license provenance, scaled assemblies and close side/front/three-quarter comparisons. State reconstructed unseen construction and color as liberties.
- Verify the exported assembly in browser and document bytes, material slots and texture memory; rider animation/interaction remains later tickets.

## Shared requirements

Owner request, 2026-10-18: two epics below portable humans; inspect both research viewers and existing wagons; build photographic-quality period models first, then distant movement, riders/drivers, and eventually boarding/riding. Explicitly authorized parallel work. Implementation target is `kevinrhaas/chicago` **dev**; use the existing isolated checkout, no worktree unless requested.

- Keep 1812/1835, pre-fire (through 1871), and Prairie Avenue 1904 eligibility separate. Later images may support a labeled period analogy, never establish earlier Chicago presence. Do not call the Pullman-location carriage Pullman-owned without evidence.
- Resolve every implementation source ID in `data/sources/`; distinguish attested, inferred with reasoning, and bounded reconstruction. Unknown dimensions/color/breed do not block a defensible reconstruction; record bounds and liberties. Never promote a guess to attested.
- Text citation of rights-pending sources is permitted; assets must not be derived from them. Every shipped asset/input carries license provenance. Prefer project-authored or institutionally cleared references and no paid acquisition without owner authorization.
- Photographic quality is an acceptance target, not a status label. Compare actual renders against dated source views at matched cameras, record discrepancies and what is hidden/inferred. Do not close on a placeholder silhouette or unseen screenshot. Keep black-and-white sources distinct from reconstructed color.
- Canonical deliverables follow the existing portable export pipeline: authored masters where supported, glTF/GLB + engine-neutral JSON, metres and explicitly tested axes, licensed materials and near/mid/far LODs. No Blender installation on the improve runner; mark `needs_bake` honestly.
- Preserve existing placed static wagons; route/actor integration is additive. Existing camera horse/wagon paces do not count as a rendered animal/vehicle or a working riding interaction.
- Measure GLB/texture bytes, triangles, draw calls, texture memory and frame cost for the selected desktop/mobile specimen. Reuse materials and population budgets; do not regress the phone memory work above this band.
- Rider/driver work reuses portable humans and follows the owner's current depiction rulings (T-2672); isolated test fixtures can validate attachments before scene release. No invented named likenesses, dialogue or ceremonies.

## Evidence

Read `evidence/period-transport-2026-10-18/carriages.md`, `horses.md`, and `viewer-survey.md`. They distinguish pixel inspection from metadata, record coverage and rights, and explain external archive access blockers. The Prairie visual pass was targeted, not all 944 source records were visually reviewed. Read the master specifications as they are added; they are a first-pass design, not proof of finished models.
