Match Philo Carpenter's log shop (the Sauganash's log wing) to its pictures.

Owner, 2026-10-11: "if you have an image you should work towards it until it's a photographic representation of any images even drawings are ok, but it should look exactly perfectly like the image or drawing"; "redo any work already done to meet this high standard"; "you don't wrap the case until it matches the photo".

This building was built without being checked against its pictures (inventory of 2026-10-11, T-2368; compared before: partial). Open every picture listed here and read the building off the picture itself. Solve each one's camera into `data/reference_views/<structure_id>/<view>.json`, render with `node tools/photo_match.mjs`, and rebuild until the side-by-side shows nothing the picture shows differently: massing, bays, every opening's shape and height, ornament, cornice, porch and stoop, roof and chimneys, fence, materials and tone (AGENTS.md rule 11; `data/reference_views/README.md`). What the picture does not show stays reconstructed and recorded in `docs/LIBERTIES.md`.

Pictorial sources are tier 5: form only, never a coordinate. Several are drawn from memory or later (Andreas 1884, Kurz & Allison 1893), and some post-date 1835 (each is evidence of its own date, scene 1835-07-01, AGENTS.md rule 3): the build follows what each shows of the building as it stood then, and the match record says which picture governs where they disagree.

Pictures:
  source: `data/sources/andreas_1884_sauganash_hotel_plate.json`
  source: `data/sources/trowbridge_sauganash_hotel.json`
  picture: `chicago/reference/images/chicago/chicago_sauganash_hotel_1831_petford.jpg`
  picture: `chicago/reference/images/chicago/chicago_sauganash_hotel_1831.jpg`
  picture: `chicago/reference/images/chicago/chicago_sauganash_tavern_1835.jpg`

**Acceptance:** every reference view of the building(s) below has its camera, its side-by-side from the GLB in the tree, and a match record with verdict `matches` and nothing open. The PR carries the before and after side-by-sides, plus desktop and 390x780 in-app shots with no page errors.

## Picture-review checkpoint — 2026-10-22

The annex is a separate structure, not a second hotel wing to re-enable. Refine tall multipane sash and brick stack from the rights-cleared Braunhold plate. Preserve the July 1835 function: former shop/school, current use unattested.

No matching verdict or completion is claimed. See the [shared compound-render checkpoint](https://github.com/kevinrhaas/chicago/blob/steward/t3040-fort-reference-groups/chicago/4d/docs/RESEARCH/fort-reference-groups-T-3040/README.md) for source/date findings and the next implementation step.
